## **Design Document**
### **Introduction**
CapCity Presents is a show promotion/booking agency. CapCity Presents' Website will be a one-stop informational page for concert patrons to learn about what it is, who's behind it, and what events are coming up. It will also be easy for booking agents and bands to make contact with Andy Moreno, who runs it.

### **General**
**Color Theme**
The following colors are the desired color theme as indicated by the client. We settled on these colors so as to stay consistent with the black-and-white logo, while adding a slight splash of color to zest things up.

<strong>Eerie Black</strong> - #171616<br>
<strong>Jet</strong> - #303030<br>
<strong>Light Gray</strong> - #d3d3d3<br>
<strong>Light Cobalt Blue</strong> - #85b5dc<br>
<strong>White</strong> - #ffffff<br>
